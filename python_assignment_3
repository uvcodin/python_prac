# diff b/w "===" and "=="

# "==" and "===" are both equality operators, but "===" is a strict equality operator while "==" is a normal equality operator. "===" will compare the type of data along with the data. (9 === "9") will return false while (9 == "9") will return true.

# pass,continue,break statements in if-else 

emp = ["ram","sham","pam","uv","mohit","speed","jay","shanks","zombs"]

for i in emp:
    if i == "sham":
        pass            # null statement
    
    elif i == "uv":
        continue        # "uv" will be skipped and loop will continue executing
    elif i == "shanks":
        break           # "shanks" will be skipped and loops will not execute any further
    print(i) 
    
# range() prog  with start,stop and step as parameters

for x in range(10,100,10):
